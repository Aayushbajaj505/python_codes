Hash Tables
    It is a data structure which has a key value pair
    Dictionray is an implementation of the hash table data structure in python

HAshing(hash functions)
    In a has table a new index is processed using the keys and the 
    elemtn corresponding to that key is stored in the index 
    This process is called hashing 

Hash Collision
    When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys ther wil be a conflict 
    THis is called Hash collission

    Solution

    Collisson resolution by chaining 
        In chaining, if ahash function produces the same index for multiple 
        elements, these elemts are stored in a doubly linked list
