Multiple Ways of solving PRoblems:
    1. Divide and conqer:
        Merge sort
        Quick sort
        Binary Search 
        Strassens Matrix Multiplication
        Closet pair 
    
    2. Dynammic programming:
        similar to previous but each sub problems are not solved independently
        rather results of the sub problems are remebered  used for similar or 
        overlaping sub problems.

        Dynamic algorithsm use memoization

        Knapsack problems
